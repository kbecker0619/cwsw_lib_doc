====== Tuesday 15 Oct 2019 ======

begin working on my host computer (work laptop), my SME playground
* intended to be a self-contained repo, used to play with my architecture.
* have decided that the multiple subrepos i used until now, is WAY too complicated. now envision each component (what used to be the container repo for that component) to have everything in it

install "cevelop", as it has built-in support for "includator" and "CUTE"
* as much as i like CUnit w/ NetBeans, it's worth exploring something new
* begin w/ a CDT hello world, to confirm that both [[MinGW]] and Cygwin build & debug
* wanted to begin w/ highest level i've developed since 2017, but after floundering a bit, decided to work from the ends towards the middle, stubbing / mocking along the way.
* on GH public, renamed one of my currently-unused repos to "cwsw_sme_playground"
* pushed HW to it

* pulled in cwsw_lib, and refactored it in place
