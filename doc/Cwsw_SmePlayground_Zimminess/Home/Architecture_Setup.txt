====== Architecture Setup ======
Created Thursday 21 December 2017

see daily notes - current idea changed enough relative to original idea, that it's not worth redoing here
original: 21-dec-2017
update: 06-jan-2018

Microchip target:
Debug_Win_MZ2048EFM : Development and debugging on Windows, using Microchip XC Build Tools
new env-vars:
	''PIC32_XC_HOME=G:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx\bin''
		on 2nd test installation: E:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx
	''PIC32_XC_INCLUDE=G:\_Programs\Microchip\xc32\v1.44\pic32mx\include''

Cross prefix: (nil)
Cross path:	''${PIC32_XC_HOME}''
Include path:	${''PIC32_XC_INCLUDE}''
	[ ] 09-jan: manually added this into Eclipse' workspace on Linux; didn't bother exporting it to the main PATH statement.

to refresh, for MinGW, the two main env-vars:
	''MINGW_HOME=C:\MinGW''		(or wherever you installed MinGW)
	''MSYS_HOME=C:\MinGW\msys\1.0''	(again, verify this is the correct location)
