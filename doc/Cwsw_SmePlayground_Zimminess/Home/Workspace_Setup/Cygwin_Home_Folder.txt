====== Cygwin Home Folder ======
Created Wednesday 13 December 2017

1. New Windows environment variable, HOME, equated to your Windows user folder. Warning against this is that it doesn't work in all cases for all tools, though I mysefl haven't yet seen this.
2. One of several config settings in [[/etc.]]
3. remove (or rename) your Cygwin home folder, then set up a symlink to your Windows user folder. This is what I tried before I found the tip about the HOME env-var.
