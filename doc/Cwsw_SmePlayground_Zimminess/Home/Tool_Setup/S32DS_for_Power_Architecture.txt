====== S32DS for Power Architecture ======
Created Thursday 03 October 2019

Previously, on this machine before installing Win10 on top of my wasn't-broken-working-just-spiffy WIn7 install, had v2017.R1 installed, and last I knew, it worked.

per https://community.nxp.com/docs/DOC-343864, there's a new version i should use.
* uninstall stalled, abort & manually delete, then run ccleaner (even Task Manager couldn't kill the uninstall task, which was a java app)
* installed S32DS v3.2, evidently that's for ARM. uninstalled, run ccleaner. still worried that it "polluted" my machine.
* installed [[https://nxp.flexnetoperations.com/control/frse/download?agree=Accept&element=10944607|S32 Design Studio for Power Architecture]] (S32DS-PA_v2.1)

* frustrated w/ above, gave up. uninstalled and tried again.
* followed NSP's [[https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/DEVKIT-MPC5748G-SWIG.pdf|SWIG]]
