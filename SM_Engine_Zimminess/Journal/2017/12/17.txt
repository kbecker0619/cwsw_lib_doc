====== Sunday 17 Dec 2017 ======

last night, "stopped" work on my work laptop, and tried to pull everything back into my personal Windows VM. evidently, my old git workspace was stale, and i couldn't figure out how to make the pull successful, so since there was nothing at risk, trashed the old workspace and created a fresh clone.

===== lib =====
since my S32DS workspace (ne Eclipse Neon) had to be recreated, i confirmed ability to create a debuggable Lib project
in [[NetBeans]] 8.1, created a new project from makefile, successfully debugged.

===== clock =====
[*] S32DS: successfully debugged build target ''XPRJ_Debug_Win_MinGW''
[*] [[NetBeans]] 8.1: well, the creation of the project from makefiles was successful, but the includes paths were wrong - due to the diff between the way i defined the project in eclipse, vs. the way that NB imported it. not wanting to ruin the eclipse project by updating the makefiles (not sure that would matter, but still, just to be safe ...)
	[*] created new project & imported the folders
	[*] futzed with project properties until it looked like that from the Eclipse build. as part of that,
		[*] NB wasn't automatically defining the XPRJ_xxx command-line macro, so i defined ''XPRJ_Debug_Win_MinGW'' manually. this is acceptable because i'm using exactly the same compiler & debugger as i would in eclipse, and, i am not relying on anthing specific to either eclipse or netbeans.
[ ] MPLAB X: Because one of my goals over this Christmas break, is to get my SM working on a target, and one of the (3) targets I have in my hot little hands is a PIC 32 MZ-based board, and because I already did the ground work with NB, downloaded and installed this in my personal Daily Dev VM.
	[*] installed
		[*] [[http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers|xc32 cross compiler]]
		[*] mplab x
		[*] [[http://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony|harmony 2.04]]
	[*] immediately upon installation, tried to open the NB project - low & behold, MPLAB's version of NB is older than the version I have installed, which itself isn't the newest version.
	[*] note: mplab seems to have a nice GIT integration i didn't notice in the OOTB NB install.
	[ ] took quite a big detour while installing mplab, got something working that didn't work the last time i tried: mz easy board, under simulation, and visualizer shows GPIO ports change. eventually, i want to use this harmony-generated code as the foundation for my state machine (maybe, the ui, to show what state is active, as well as the switch to insert a coin).
	[ ] found the templates used by the harmony generator, added "WEAK" attribute to the public functions in the main app templates; this so i can have "sister" modules that have non-weakly-bound functions. note this approach still doesn't address the static helper functions the code generator throws in (but hey, they're static, so they aren't visible outside of the module anyway).
