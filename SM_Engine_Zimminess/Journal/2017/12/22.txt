===== clock & mplabx, cont =====
well, last night, the power supply for my personal machine died, so i quick-a-minute saved what i needed & transferred everything to my personal-dev VM on my work machine.

as part of that, my installation of MPLAB was in a different position, so this was a good chance to confirm assumptions i had made on my personal-dev VM on my personal machine.
	[ ] personal-personal-dev installed all the microchip stuff on drive G, my work-personal-dev VM installed it all on drive E:
	[ ] to maintain the HACK-DON'T-DO-THIS, symlink i created in the Clock project to the Harmony install, I created a new drive G: (via subst) and voila! it worked.
