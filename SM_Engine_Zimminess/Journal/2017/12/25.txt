well, over and here & about, i've been trying to get the MHC framework to work with [[MinGW]] in eclipse. it's turning into more effort than i care to exert, and in addition, i find i'm making changes to the installed MHC headers i don't really want to make.

so, removed the symlink to "framework" in my project, and created a legitimate folder "framework", with the idea being to copy over files as needed, as i'm doing with the code created by the MHC generator. this is intended to be a short-lived, transitional thing, but who knows, i may not ever get passed it.
