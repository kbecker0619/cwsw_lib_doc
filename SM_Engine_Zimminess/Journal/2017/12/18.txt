===== mplabx, cont =====
still on the (general) path of getting the clock module to work cross-platform on my personal vm. it works from within eclipse / s32ds, natch, but took a detour to get my Microchip MZ EZ board working

* took another significant detour, finding the online [[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MPLAB%20Harmony%20Tutorial%20-%20Creating%20an%20Application_v111.pdf|harmony tutuorial]] that walks you through a "blinky" application. next will be the code that i used before, with older versions of mplab and harmony, that makes the leds react to switch presses.
