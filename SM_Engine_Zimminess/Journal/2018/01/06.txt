====== Saturday 06 Jan 2018 ======

update to architecture-specfic layout, developed on linux, relative to earlier experiment, done on windows
inputs:
* more thought
* experience moving from one Win7 environ to another (different VMs, set up slightly differently)
* experience moving from Win7 environ to Xubuntu 16

done in xubuntu 16

expectations:
[ ] use MPLAB + Harmony v2.05 to create a "sister" project
	[ ] note that earlier project, created on Win7 using Harmony v2.04, would not open in the Linux MPLAB sans errors. I saw the project in the project browser, but there was no content
	[ ] created a new, sister project, "''cwsw_dio_mhc''"
	[ ] configuration name was "''pic32mz_ef_sk''" — this same name will be used for a build configuration in Eclipse
	[ ] **note that for my idea to work, the project names in both MPLAB and in Eclipse must match **("''cwsw_dio''" in this case)

	[ ] WRT the "selective copy" done between "''framework''" folders - i don't really care for the implmentation of "app" and "bsp" created by Harmony - it's not bad, it just isn't how i want to organize the project — therefore, i may or may not end up with these files. also, certain other files (and even folders) in the generated tree will be rearranged slightly in the parts of the project used by Eclipse.
	[ ] Note: based on present experience, it appears there will ALWAYS be some "tweaking" of the project, when opened in Win7 vs. when opened in Linux. At the least, I would guess you'll have to
		[ ] respecify the location of the Harmony framework, when opening the MHC tool
		[ ] respecify or reselect the location of the build tools in the project properties


early afternoon:
[ ] created new component project, "cwsw_arch". this will be a bit special, in that it is intended simply to be a container for all stuff specifically related to architecture support; as such, it really (at this time, anyway) won't have a valid unit test
[ ] moved all existing content of the dio component's "cwsw_arch" folder into the new home; confirmed that the dio project is now fatally broken
[ ] created symlink from the arch component into the dio project, replacing previous content. confirmed build works again.
[ ] added new symlink to git index manually (command line). committed changes.
________________________________________
[ ] note this plan does disrupt my previous idea, not expressed in writing until now, of sym-linking from the pic32 arch & board folders into the MHC project that's a sister of the DIO working folder. ... developing ...
[ ] repeated above exercise for board support:
[ ] created new component project, "cwsw_board". this also is intended mainly to be a container for all stuff specifically related to the project board.
[ ] moved all existing content of the dio "cwsw_board" folder into the new home; confirmed the dio project is now fatally broken.
