====== Monday 08 Jan 2018 ======

continued yesterday's exploration of DIO buildup, but in office on my personal Win7 VM. had LOTS of trouble hooking up w/ github; ended up using HTTPS, retrieving onto my host, then syncing w/ VM's workspace. intent: at end of day, sync bac, then commit. ugh.

the way i did it, symlinks came in as folders. deleted the folders, recreated the symlinks; this may be a problem when syncing back to the host, as you need admin rights to do this.

in fact, to prevent the problem, i'll do it now directly on the host.

oh, wait ... on the host, they ARE symlinks. yea. that part worked correctly; what didn't work was the ability to see them as symlinks when viewed from the VM.

the envars ''PIC32_XC_xxx'' are already set up, but needed correction.
created the new ''MPLAB_UTILS_HOME'' env-var.

still with the "can't find <xc.h>" thing. not sure if it's real, or just an artifact of the CDT parser - there aren't any error messages related to this in the console window during a build ...

think i have an idea for integrating MCH framework & generated code .. for now, i'm going to symlink to the app-gen code, but copy as-needed to the framework, and when i get running, i'll delete the files & replace them w/ symlinks.

my idea requires me to erplace the existing symlink to "bsp", because i'm moving the folder, so the relational link will break.
