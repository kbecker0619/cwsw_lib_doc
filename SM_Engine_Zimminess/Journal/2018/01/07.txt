====== Sunday 07 Jan 2018 ======

continued yesterday's exploration of DIO buildup

pulled the Linux commit into my home Win7 dev; the symlinks for arch & board didn't come over cleanly.
hmmm

recreated the symlinks, added to git index
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"

$ rm -rf arch
$ rm -rf cwsw_arch
$ rm -rf cwsw_board
$ ln -s ../cwsw_arch_prj/cwsw_arch cwsw_arch
$ ln -s ../cwsw_board_prj/cwsw_board cwsw_board
$ git add cwsw_arch cwsw_board
$
}}}


evening: 
ok, in windows, there's also a problem w/ XC32 cross-compilation; since I didn't create env-vars in Linux, the definitions provided in the Eclipse project definition is used, but it's wrong for windows.

So the new plan: delete the Eclipse definition, use the env-vars, and then, when i get back to Linux, create corresponding env-vars.

[ ] next problem: there's no make utility in the XC32 folders ...
	[ ] how does MPLAB do it?
	[ ] answer: MPLAB provides it, in the [[gnuBins]] folder
	[ ] created new Eclipse (temporary, to test it out) env-var named MPLAB_UTILS_HOME, pointing to this folder
		[ ] ''MPLAB_UTILS_HOME=G:\_Programs\Microchip\MPLABX\v4.05\gnuBins\GnuWin32\bin'' on this system
[ ] bsp folder for mz-ez board:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"

$ ln -s ../../firmware/src/system_config/pic32mz_ef_sk/bsp bsp
}}}

[ ] thus, begins a whole huge long exercise to try to graft the MHC ecosystem into my project.
