====== Friday 05 Jan 2018 ======

Finished job started yesterday, of making stuff work in my Linux VM.
Installed MPLAB, disproved hope that same exact project would work in both Linux and Windows. Kinda-sorta played around with the DIO MPLAB project, merging settings from the newer (v2.05 vs v2.04) version of Harmony into the committed project, but only did this half-heartedly. Didn't test squat.

Today, spent 1st part of day "fixing" all the libraries built up so far, in s32ds (ne Eclipse Neon) so that they work in Linux.
As part of this, added build target "''Debug_Linux_GCC:Development and debugging on Linux, using GCC''"
