incremental progress in cwsw_arch module.

as of yesterday, i had quite a bit of problem with lost files, when pusing from windows / switching to linux & editing / pushing / switching back to windows. the files were present on linux, but somehow GIT thought i deleted them when i came back to windows.

then, magically, this morning, i did a fresh pull, and the files reappeared.

as of the time of this writing (09:15), i have a workable UT for arch for linux dev running on linux, for windows dev running on windows, and for PIC32 MZ EZ, simulation, running on windows. i am just about to commit, and then begin development for ONE CORE for calypso.

	''Debug_Linux_GCC:Development and debugging on Linux, using GCC''
	''Debug_Win_MinGW:Development and debugging on Windows, using MinGW''
	''Debug_Win_MZ2048EFM:Development and debugging on Windows, using Microchip XC Build Tools''

note: i still cannot successfully build for MZ within Eclipse, but this is not a high priority at the moment because my MPLAB project runs "my" code.

for the moment, i have chosen to dev one core only, because i don't want to mess with the NXP way of defining 3 linked projects. this can come later.

	''Debug_XC_MPC57xx_DevKit:Development and debugging on Windows and Linux desktop, using NXP Build Tools''

To each, need to add command-line symbol	''XPRJ_${ConfigName}=1''
