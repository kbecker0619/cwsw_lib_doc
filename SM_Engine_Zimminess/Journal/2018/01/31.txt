====== Wednesday 31 Jan 2018 ======

04:00 AM, begin on the Calypso experiment (couldn't sleep)

1. create HW app from new project wizard, core 0 only.
2. build & single-step, DEBUG and DEBUG RAM build targets.
	a. 1st problem: build cannot find make. wtf??
		[ ] path in eclipse was wrong; changed it to "''E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_Power_v1.2\utils\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin''" and correct functionality was restored.
		[ ] of course, there was a sister version in "''E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_Power_v1.2\utils\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin''", but that is not terribly relevant.
	b. over several days now, have not been able to attach P&E USB devices (2 are shown) to the VM; need to explore this soon, but not a priority for this specific exercise.
3. copy old (working cwsw_arch) into new (NXP HW project), using Eclipse symlinks only (because they're easier than filesystem symlinks; however, the NXP builds use an external make, so i don't know if this will work or not.
	a. upon adding "projcfg.h" (1st change made), had to change build target names - rather than renaming, i added.
		* ''Debug_XC_MPC57xx_DevKit:Development and debugging on Windows and Linux desktop, using NXP Build Tools'' — copied from Debug
		* ''Debug_XC_MPC57xx_DevKit_RAM:Development and debugging on Windows and Linux desktop, using NXP Build Tools'' — copied from Debug RAM
	b. the Eclipse symlinks don't work. reverting to filesystem symlinks.
	c. added projcfg.h
	d. due to a dependency, added cwsw_lib/
	e. added cmdline define "''XPRJ_${ConfigName}=1''"
	f. ok, i think this is going to work. at home, cannot get USB to even recognize my Calypso board ... surprises me greatly ... dunno what's going on.
4. create new project from example. i want blinky lights and board support, so i selected "hello + pll + interrupts" from list of examples. this is a tri-core project, and i want to begin the "arch" component for calypso with one core, so i will work on moving the functionality in the 2nd and 3rd cores into the 1st core.
	a. corrected path to make.exe
	b. built all / launched debug grouping. error: "Error while launching command: ''E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_Power_v1.2\eclipse\../Cross_Tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb --version''"
		* note this points to an ARM folder - i'm building a powerpc ... duh
		* path should be "''E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_Power_v1.2\Cross_Tools\powerpc-eabivle-4_9\bin''"
		* file should be "''powerpc-eabivle-gdb.exe''"
		* in Debug Configs, GDB command is "''${cross_prefix}gdb${cross_suffix}''"
		* in Project Properties / Build Variables, "''${cross_prefix}''" = "''powerpc-eabivle-''", and "${cross_suffix}" = ""
		* hmmm, not sure how the debug config is pulling the S32K144 settings, when it appears all are correct for Calypso.
		* I am fairly sure this is being fed by my (a) upgrade of Power from older Eclipse base, combined with (b) reusing the same workspace for both ARM and Power arch targets.
	c. New Workspace, Repeat New Project From Example
		* reused sqsp workspace, upgraded upon opening (which proves it was created by the original v1.2 Calypso)
		* this built fine, but once again, VBox couldn't pass the USB port through.
		* As I'll be home tomorrow, and my Mac is there, I'll try on that machine.
	d. In the mean time, successfully moved the core 1 & 2 functionality into the Core 0 project. Can't tell yet if it actually works, since i cannot hook up to the board.
