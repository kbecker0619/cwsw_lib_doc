Continue NXP experiment

[*] on host machine, installed brand-spankin'-new copies of the PE drivers. This made the "Warning" icons in Device Manager go away, and then when I restarted the VM, it automatically connected.
[x] reopened the unbroken-but-now-upgraded workspace i tried last night, tried to connect. futzed around for ~ 15 minutes; it seems to find & program, but when it tries to start execution, it disconnects and fails (tried running directly, didn't work)
[ ] used new project wizard to create absolute minimal core-0-only HW app
	[x] no joy
	[ ] switch to linux?
