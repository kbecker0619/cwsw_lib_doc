====== Thursday 08 Feb 2018 ======

continue w/ reinstallation of build tools, but this time, only as needed.

[*] open new instance of s32ds, do test build of existing cwsw_arch project using mingw.
[ ] switch to build target "Debug_XC_MPC57xx_DevKit''".''
	[ ] as before, "make" not found in path ... this confirms, in my mind, that the WS was corrupted by s32ds ARM usage 1st, which reinforces the need to keep the workspaces separate for all different tools. yuck. wish 'twere different.
[*] create new WS, DID NOT copy old, but as sister to it (fail)
	[*] "''wsCwsw_Lib_nxp_W7''"
	[*] moved the calypso-centric projects that were within the old workspace, out of that ws, so that they're now sisters to all of the other project folders in the parent of the eclipse ws.
		[*] hello_Interrupts
		[*] hello+pll+interrupt
		[*] hw_blinky
		[*] hw_z0
	[x] imported cwsw_arch project
		[*] confirmed mingw build
		[x] test build nxp target
		[x] still problems building
		[*] by looking @ build vars, w/ "show system" enabled, it looks like there's a bunch of ARM and CORTEX settings, which makes me think that the new WS copied from the existing, even though that wasn't my intent.
[ ] create new WS, with the previous NXP WS as current
	[ ] still no joy
[ ] problem ended up being, the build target had no build artifact type. set to 'e200 executable' and extension .elf, and then it compiled, but had a link error.
	[ ] i think the change that mattered, was setting the library in the "Target Processor" section of the Tools Settings dialog.
	[ ] i selected "newlib_nano debug"
[ ] next link error: "''real-ld.exe: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 01800090''"
	[*] copied "Project_Settings" folder from NXP example project. in a subfolder, this contained "startup.S"
	[*] updated linker / general settings to reference the .ld files in that folder tree.
	[ ] in example project, this was in root folder; i am sure i don't want it there, but still, there are files in this folder that should be set on a per-project basis.
	[x] tbd: figure this out

[ ] BUILD UP - NXP ARCH
	[ ] copied "MPC57xx__Interrupt_Init.c"
		[ ] dependency: copied derivative.h. IGNORE the file header that says, "do not modify."
			[ ] dependency: #include <MPC5748G.h>
		[ ] added my own call to include "MPC57xx__Interrupt_Init.h"
	[ ] void xcptn_xmpl(void)

[ ] interlude, while i reinstall some add-ins, as listed [[Journal:2018:02:s32ds arm installed software|here]]
