continuing Calpyso experiment begun [[Journal:2018:01:31|Wednesday 31 Jan 2018]]

1. in Calypso-based workspace, create new project from example. i want blinky lights and board support, so i selected "hello + pll + interrupts" from list of examples. this is a tri-core project, and i want to begin the "arch" component for calypso with one core, so i will work on moving the functionality in the 2nd and 3rd cores into the 1st core.
2. move all unique functionality, including ISR table, to core0 project. couldn't test, because my board won't connect.
3. symlinked ARCH's version of "projcfg.h", created new (additional) build target name:
	* ''Debug_XC_MPC57xx_DevKit:Development and debugging on Windows and Linux desktop, using NXP Build Tools'' â€” copied from Debug
4. due to a dependency, added cwsw_lib/
5. added cmdline define "''XPRJ_${ConfigName}=1''"
6. deleted command-line defines "''TURN_ON_CPU1''" and "''TURN_ON_CPU2''"
7. not sure exactly what i did to make it build, but finally, it did build, after some futzing.
8. added call to ''Init(Cwsw_Lib);''
