====== Monday 19 Feb 2018 ======

on home system, installed the v2 ppc version of s32ds.

after accepting the default workspace, the test build of cwsw_arch, "worked" except for a few includes path problems.

created a new workspace, and it couldn't find gcc. not sure what went wrong

copied the working workspace to the components dev folder, imported cwsw_arch, fixed a few things, and voila, it worked.
