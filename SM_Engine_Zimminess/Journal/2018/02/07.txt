===== RESET !!!! =====

i am TIRED of all the problems i'm having with connectivity to my various boards within the personal windows VM on my work-related laptop.

**I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT, WHILE IT MAY APPEAR AT A SURFACE AND MID-LEVEL VIEW TO WORK FINE, THAT IN REALITY THE ARM AND MPC57xx VERSIONS OF S32DS DO NOT PLAY WELL TOGETHER, AND YOU SHOULD EAT THE DISK SPACE AND SIMPLY HAVE SEPARATE WORKSPACES FOR THEM.**

[ ] because i am still (mostly) connectable w/ MPLAB and my MZ-EZ board, leave that installation alone.
[ ] because last i knew, i was OK w/ Atmel's VS-based IDE, left that installation alone (for now). note that MPLAB has some "xplained" board stuff in it, so my intent is to try my SAMV71 board on mplab.

[*] NetBeans is not installed in this VM, so it doesn't need uninstalling - which is good, because it is newer than the version of NB used by MPLAB and cannot open MPLAB projects anyway)
[*] uninstalled the P&E drivers from the host. didn't reboot yet.
[*] uninstalled the P&E drivers (installed only on the 2nd of Feb) from the VM
[*] uninstalled "''Windows Driver Package - IAR Systems (IJET) IARUSB  (05/23/2012 2.05)''", since i've never actually used it anyway. i will (or rather, i intend to), but haven't yet.
	[*] MDK524a.EXE (install app for ... IAR?) is on the host, in my download folder
	[*] EWARM-KS-CD-6405.exe (install app for IAR) is on the host, in my download folder
[*] uninstalled "Windows Driver Package - Segger (jlink) USB  (01/26/2017 2.70.08.0)"
[*] at this point, noticed that the P&E driver entry still showed up in my installed-apps list, so rebooted.
[*] s32ds ARM:
	[*] S32DS_ARM_Win32_v2.0_b170810.exe (install app) is on the host, in my download folder
	[*] [[s32ds arm installed software|document add-ins]]. startup banner says "neon 3"
	[*] uninstall. i was surprised when [[InstallAnywhere]] said it was removing the software license, so i'll probably need to reacquire one when i reinstall.
	[*] the folder "''E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_ARM_v2.0''" remained, so cleaned it up
	[*] run ccleaner
	[*] confirm project still opens in eclipse. debugged live! yea!
	[*] confirm project still opens in (corrupted) s32ds-calypso
[*] s32ds calypso:
	[*] not sure where the install file is - but, this originally used an older version of eclipse anyway (i updated it in place), so i will redownload it.
	[*] uninstall.
	[*] the folder "E:\_Programs\NXP\S32DS_Power_v1.2" remained, so cleaned it up
	[*] run ccleaner
	[*] Freescale [[FreeMASTER]] 2.0 remains in nxp folder
	[*] confirm project still opens in eclipse. debugged live! yea!
	[*] i didn't bring my calypso board to work with me today, so i cannot (yet) see what is the reaction when i plug in & pass USB through to the VM.
[*] uninstall FreeMASTER. entry still remains in installed-apps list, so reboot. clean up folder remains.
[*] uninstall "''IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM Kickstart''". saved registration text file in downloads
[*] uninstalled Keil ÂµVision4.
[*] uninstalled "''Windows Driver Package - IAR Systems (IJET) IARUSB  (05/23/2012 2.05)''"

[*] attached 1 (of 3 i have access to) atmel samv71 xplained boards - windows seemed unable to pass the device through to the VM.
[x] closed VM, cleaned up some Device Manager connections in host, and voila! Atmel now passed through (visible) to VM. **HOWEVER**, when i connect it, the original EDGB port is replaced by 2 Atmel-specific ports, and neither of these connects.
	[x] "''Atmel Corp. Xplained board debugger and programmer [0101]''"
	[x] "''Atmel Corp. EDBG CMSIS-DAP [0101]''"
[*] **WOW!! VM WINDOWS NOW GOES SO MUCH FASTER!!** still not speedster, but very, very noticably more responsive.
[*] the Microchip MZ-EZ board is passed through and connects to MPLAB.
	[*] while MPLAB open, received and accepted notice to download upgrade to v4.10.
	[*] uninstalled "''MPLAB X IDE v4.05''", w/ ccleaner run after
	[*] installed v4.10

[ ] downloaded calypso version of [[https://nxp.flexnetoperations.com/control/frse/download?agree=Accept&element=9231157|s32ds]]
	[ ] Activation Code: "[[https://nxp.flexnetoperations.com/control/frse/dload_serialNum?item_key=9231157&plne=712807&certNum=426676047|0315-AF5B-65A3-F279]]"
	[ ] realize - whoops - i forgot to document my add-ins like i did with the ARM version. oh well.
	[ ] created project from example, "hello + pll + interrupt"
	[ ] hmm, USB devices still not connectable within VM.
