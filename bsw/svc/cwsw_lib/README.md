# CWSW Library

## Overview

This repo holds the full set of documents for the small CWSW Library.
Being the building block upon which other CWSW components are built, it
has no dependencies to other CWSW components.

This repo is the composed of a mixture of direct files and folders, and
GIT submodules for reusable portions of the component; namely, sources,
documentation, and unit testing (this component uses CUnit, hosted
natively by NetBeans).

The source repo for this component is best inserted in the Services
layer (if you have one). It contains core, stateless, utility functions
that can be called by any application or driver layer module.
