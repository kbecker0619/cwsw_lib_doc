====== Tuesday 09 Jan 2018 ======

continued yesterday's exploration of DIO buildup, in office, on personal Win7 VM. gave up on Linux VM; it's far too slow this morning, not sure why

decided that i would now use the embedded MPLAB project to explore the Eclipse implementation; in other words, I'm going to add in the same files from the same locations as used in the Eclipse project. To generate the reference project, which i use to develop the Eclipse version, I'm going to create another embedded MPLAB project, "cwsw_dio_ref", configuration name "''pic32mz_ef_sk''"
