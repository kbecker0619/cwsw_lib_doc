continuing w/ microchip, but decided i needed a DIO library implemented before my clock lib, because, i want to use the DIO in the UT for my clock lib
also, dug out an old STM project, which turned out to have an ARM 7, so hey, i'm now golden - ATMEL SAMV71, and now, STR730-SK.

Microchip's new project wizard **REALLY** wants to be given a virgin workspace - refuses to create a configuration if the folder isn't empty. so,
[ ] created cwsw_dio_mhc, as sister to existing cwsw_dio_prj
[ ] copied 'firmware' folder carte blanch into existing cwsw_dio_prj
[ ] renamed all instances of 'cwsw_dio_mhc' in all files, to 'cwsw_dio'
	[ ] except: file "cwsw_dio_mhc.hconfig" is now "cwsw_dio.hconfig"
