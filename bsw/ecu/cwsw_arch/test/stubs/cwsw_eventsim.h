/**	In the absence of a real event system, this is the payload for our simulated
 *	event.
 *	The 1st field, as I envision it, is reserved for the event ID, but the way I've implemented this
 *	pseudo-system, that is redundant, as the name of the event handler itself is unique to the
 *	event; also, it's very difficult to create a field of enumerated constants before that
 *	enumeration has been defined (one way or the other, there needs to be a forward reference).
 *	Therefore, do with the 1st field what you will.
 *
 *	One suggestion: if you want a generic event handler, you can then put a unique identifier
 *	(as in, the event, cause, reason, etc. code) into the evId field.

/**	Directly notify interested parties of a significant event.
 * 	This mechanism is intended to provide a very simple mechanism to send a
 * 	message to an independent part of your software.
 *
 * 	This is an undirected, unqueued "event". It calls the specified event
 * 	handler immediately. Because of this, the recommendation is that the handler
 * 	should be very short, perhaps only setting a flag that is processed by the
 * 	receiver of the event.
 *
 * 	These macros are designed to look to the sender like a simple event posting,
 * 	and to the subscriber (receiver), an event handler or callback.
 *
 * 	Unlike some event systems, we don't specify a handler, because we don't care
 * 	who all subscribes to our data. As implemented now, there is one C *symbol*
 * 	that must be defined; however, it could be a function that forwards the event
 * 	to other handlers, or a macro that iterates through an array, or ...
